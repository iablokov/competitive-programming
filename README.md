# Competitive Programming: Tools and Solutions

The purpose of this repository is to help solving typical problems found in coding challenges
by providing a comprehensive view on the main aspects of such problems.

* First, it contains the complete solutions (covered by simple unit tests) of the selected problems (mostly, from LeetCode).
* Second, it contains ready-to-use algorithms and data structures.
* Finally, for Python and Rust (C++ is coming), there is a manual on the best practices of using the language in coding challenges.

*This repository is under development. Many items are still incomplete.*
